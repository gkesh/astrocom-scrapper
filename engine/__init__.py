"""
This is where the engine starts, i.e.
any code that wishes to run the scrapper
(Comic Downloader), has to start here.

This portion of the code will only be 
responsible for downloading the files
from the given link to the output folder.
Engine will act as an atomic unit and
will return status and nothing more!

NO DATABASE OPERATIONS HERE!!
